To do list application
Allows you to keep track of things you need to do in a simple way, paper free
Developed by Rahul Jha.
Code hosted at GitHub. http://github.com/Mellen/To-do-List
The config file for the compiled code (ToDoList.exe.config) has one app setting: listFileName. This is the path and filename of XML file that stores the to do list. 
If you set the registry to make the app run when Windows starts the you will need to set this to be an absolute path.
